title: "Cider"
---

Many moons ago, I was on a trip in Dorset and we visited a country pub near Swanage, which I believe was the [Square and
Compass](https://www.squareandcompasspub.co.uk/). I remember being very taken by the cider, which was apparently brewed
locally and tasted totally different to
the commercial ciders I was familiar with at that point.

Many years later, I need a project, and the internal squirrel brain settled on the idea of doing some home fermentation.
I've fermented beer before, which was drinkable but nothing special. Given that I live in Kent and am surrounded by
apple orchards, it seemed a good idea to investigate cider-making.

From experience, I knew I'd need some things, and I'd need to learn some other things. But one thing I definitely wanted
to do was have some way to observe and track the fermentation process from the comfort of anywhere but the
spider-infested horror that doubles as my garage.

I also needed some way to protect my fermentation set-up from accidental kicks or other hazards, like having a spade
fall on it.

My daytime job is SRE, so I decided to SRE the ~~censored~~ out of this.
