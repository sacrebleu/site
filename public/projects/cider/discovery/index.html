  Discovery and Initial Planning
  #

Many moons ago, I was on a trip in Dorset and we visited a country pub near Swanage, which I believe was the Square and
Compass. I remember being very taken by the cider, which was apparently brewed
locally and tasted totally different to
the commercial ciders I was familiar with at that point.
Many years later, I need a project, and the internal squirrel brain settled on the idea of doing some home fermentation.
I&rsquo;ve fermented beer before, which was drinkable but nothing special. Given that I live in Kent and am surrounded by
apple orchards, it seemed a good idea to investigate cider-making.">

<p>Many moons ago, I was on a trip in Dorset and we visited a country pub near Swanage, which I believe was the <a href="https://www.squareandcompasspub.co.uk/">Square and
Compass</a>. I remember being very taken by the cider, which was apparently brewed
locally and tasted totally different to
the commercial ciders I was familiar with at that point.</p>
<p>Many years later, I need a project, and the internal squirrel brain settled on the idea of doing some home fermentation.
I&rsquo;ve fermented beer before, which was drinkable but nothing special. Given that I live in Kent and am surrounded by
apple orchards, it seemed a good idea to investigate cider-making.</p>
<p>From experience, I knew I&rsquo;d need some things, and I&rsquo;d need to learn some other things. But one thing I definitely wanted
to do was have some way to observe and track the fermentation process from the comfort of anywhere but the
spider-infested horror that doubles as my garage.</p>
<p>I also needed some way to protect my fermentation set-up from accidental kicks or other hazards, like having a spade
fall on it.</p>
<p>My daytime job is SRE, so I decided to SRE the <del>censored</del> out of this.</p>
<h4 id="the-cider-fermentation-lifecycle">
  The Cider Fermentation Lifecycle
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-cider-fermentation-lifecycle">#</a>
</h4>
<p>There are several stages</p>
<ol>
<li>Preparation</li>
<li>Primary fermentation</li>
<li>Bottling and secondary fermentation</li>
<li>Clarifying</li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these steps, 1. and 2. are probably the most critical, as they present the biggest risk of contamination or
catastrophe.</p>
<p>I decided that as romantic as the idea of collecting and crushing apples might sound, the reality would likely be hot
and monotonous. Instead, I will
be purchasing 5l of organic apple juice from one of Kent&rsquo;s many orchards and using that as my stock. There is a list of
things that are required for a basic
home-brewing setup, most of which are detailed below.</p>

<p>There is a secondary equipment requirement for bottling the results of the primary fermentation. I will talk through
bottling <a href="./bottling.md">here</a></p>
<p>This is great, and with all of this equipment I can probably make cider. But it will be very manual - so let&rsquo;s automate
one or two things.</p>
