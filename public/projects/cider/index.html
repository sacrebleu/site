Compass</a>. I remember being very taken by the cider, which was apparently brewed

<p>Many years later, I need a project, and the internal squirrel brain settled on the idea of doing some home fermentation.
I&rsquo;ve fermented beer before, which was drinkable but nothing special. Given that I live in Kent and am surrounded by
apple orchards, it seemed a good idea to investigate cider-making.</p>
<p>From experience, I knew I&rsquo;d need some things, and I&rsquo;d need to learn some other things. But one thing I definitely wanted
to do was have some way to observe and track the fermentation process from the comfort of anywhere but the
spider-infested horror that doubles as my garage.</p>
<p>I also needed some way to protect my fermentation set-up from accidental kicks or other hazards, like having a spade
fall on it.</p>
<p>My daytime job is SRE, so I decided to SRE the <del>censored</del> out of this.</p>
